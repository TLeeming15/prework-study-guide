# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to begin to learn how to code as well as creating a space to store important notes on what was learnt. This will help organise my learning and provide a quick and easy place to visit to look up things I cant quite remember. It is divided into HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript sections for easy reference to aid the learning process.

This Prework Study Guide is divided into four sections. These sections are the components that will be the foundation of my learning and understanding of the Coding process. Notes and reminders can be added throughout the bootcamp course as learning continues. If you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running.
